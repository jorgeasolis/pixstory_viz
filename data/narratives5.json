chador Even   clothes were sometimes without sleeves   only prayed     wished   family   not traditional They did not have much     with hijab and forced covering They wanted   include       school   wore new clothes and combed   hair but without the chador only   body covering was complete   was going   school     chador until the hijab became mandatory   the third grade   teacher stood   front     and told   not   wear blouse pants anymore and not   enter the classroom without   chador   beat   with   stick and beat     hands turned blue But   did not accept   until   the fourth grade they took off the hijab again   school using violence and   went   Kabul for   midwife'  wedding Even though   was small   had   strange fear   was   the alley when   saw   girl Someone said Wow what   dress what   colorful chador but one with   black hijab They took Skip the long story Today hijab     mandatory thing and   you wear   short       chat and   you wear   long     still These days

the Bay   Bengal   either sides India has two monsoon branches the Arabian sea branch and the Bay   Bengal branch  '  also known   the South-West monsoon and North- East monsoon Naturally Bangalore receives the best   both   these monsoons because  '  centrally located One hits the city   May and the other around October   Altitude The city stands       from sea level The higher the altitude the colder   gets Therefore the elevation also plays   crucial role   keeping the climate here moderate   Cyclone spill-overs Neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu Andhra Pradesh Odisha that are close   proximity and affected   cyclones give Bangalore spill-over showers That'  another reason this city gets   much rain   love the fact that   don'  have   spend money   electricity bills because air

patriarchy consciously   unconsciously You need     back and reread the definition   feminism   you really think that all those men who are shouting behind their Twitter accounts calling for hijabban really mean   empower Muslim women Don   you think they will not come after you and shame you   you chose   wear   bikini someday Well   know all the controversy behind the hijabban   deep rooted   Islamophobia but don   let this hate for Muslims knock you down sometime later because the patriarchy and misogyny will come after you   well   decide who you can marry what you can cook what you can reproduce and more importantly how you should   treated For all those men who are putting   ignorant argument   support   hijabban and claiming that Afghan women are fighting against Hijab   Afghanistan because the Taliban are forcing them   wear     have something   tell you   listen clear and loud   aren   fighting against hijab with the Taliban   are fighting against patriarchy who
